        node_modules: contains dB of configure dependancy
        ^ caret = minor dependancy
        ~ tlide = major dependancy
        transitive dependancy = {
            a parcel dependancy having own dependancy that own having some dependancy is called transitive dependancy
        }
    }
    npx{
        npx parcel index.html(source code)
        parcel goes to index.html which build developmemt a build and host it on localhost
