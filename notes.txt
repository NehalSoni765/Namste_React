    }
    package vs package-lock{
        package.json that have caret and tlide
        package-lock.json : always tract to the exact version which define in package.json
        node_modules: contains dB of configure dependancy
        ^ caret = minor dependancy
        ~ tlide = major dependancy
        transitive dependancy = {
            a parcel dependancy having own dependancy that own having some dependancy is called transitive dependancy
        }
    }
